# Section 7 - Model, View, Controller

## Models

* Represent your data in your code
* Work with your data (e.g. save, fetch)

## Views

* What the user sees
* Decoupled from application code

## Controllers

* Connecting your Models and Views
* Ccontains the "in-between" logic
* Routes are closely related with controllers
